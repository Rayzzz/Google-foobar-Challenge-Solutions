# Google-foobar-Challenge-Solutions

I got the Google's foobar Challenge on 15th May 2020. It really did come to me as a shock that Google thought I was good enough for it, considering the purpose of the challenge.

It is said to be some kind of a secret hiring process done by Google. This is not a challenge everyone can take; you have to be among the 'few chosen' ones. The criteria for getting this challenge is not yet clear, but it does seem like what you search, plays a role in making Google believe that you are worthy of this challenge.

One thing that I have to say is that the way they have framed and designed this challenge is commendable.
Its some sort of a mission that they assign you and you need to rise through the ranks to infiltrate and successfully take down the enemy.
I have to say it really is a fun experience in itself.

There are 5 Levels in all in the Challenge with such creative names-
* #### Level 1 
1 question and 48 hours
* #### Level 2
* #### Level 3
* #### Level 4
* #### Level 5

Creative, no?

Anyway, the excitement doesn't end here. This challenge also gives you 'rewards' after each level (except after Level 1).

P.S. I will keep on updating this information as I move to further levels...
